# AcousticModels

Matlab script generates .wav file, wich represents signal with amplitudes and frequencies similar to waveform, generated by vibroacoustic sensors on pipeline after physical impact.

## Getting Started

Just edit the path for the wave file to be exported and run script in matlab.

## Two models

Two scripts: for simple and enhanced models, based on works of:
+ Impact. Theory and Physical Properties of Impacted Bodies. Goldsmith W., 1960
+ Vibration problems in engineering. Timoshenko S.P., Young, D.H., Weaver W., 1967
